# Video


My sample mission is to find/create/architect simple "annotation, couching software".

"You're describing a telestrator, which is what people like John Madden use to show the various positions and plays in football games. "


## Features:

- choose video (quickly, drag, last used etc...)
	- local
	- net
- control playback with simple gestures 
(click, doubleclicks, some mobile equivalents), 
no buttons please, all in the video area
	- pause
	- slow down
	- backward, forward (speed of forward and backward is based on my movement speed, NO SLIDER again gesture over video)
- freehand draw using mouse, touch or pen 
	- over still video
	- over slowly running video
	- maybe just change pen color very quickly 
- freez frames
	- add freez frame
	- running anotation over freez frame
	- slow before and after freez frame	
- play with anotations 
	- stills
	- running anotation recorded during slow motion

- export video with anotations
	- as video + some metadata 
	- as video only (flaten)
	- save to local disk
	- share (FB, Youtube)
